I am @CyberSylvan - I'm here to learn more about cybersecurity, develop some of my own toolkits, grow my skills, and (hopefully) give back to the community. Well, I also want to have some fun too of course. Don't we all? I do like to hang out sometimes (or do I? .. is this just a Mr. Robot moment?), but when I'm most comfortable, you'll probably find me deep in my 'interests' dir, or reading about/playing with some new thing I found. Anyways, for the 'dir' thing to make since, proceed below. I'll grant you read access.
