# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Before you ask - No, I'm not Obi-wan, though mastering the force in a galaxy far far away would be pretty nice! I take it you're here for the grant tour, to learn a bit about me, my repositories, my stars, etc. Well, I do have some of those FAQs below - I hope it pleases - but do know that there's a cost! Yes, there is a price for doing business with every transaction: you receive any amount of knowledge by visiting pages related to me, and in return you agree to make someone's day better (in a good way); someday, somehow (that was a total Flintstones reference too btw).

    Who am I really, and what am I here for?

  ```bash
  $ whoami
  @CyberSylvan
  
  $ cat aboutme.txt
  I am @CyberSylvan - I'm here to learn more about cybersecurity, develop some of my own toolkits, 
  grow my skills, and (hopefully) give back to the community. Well, I also want to have some fun 
  too of course. Don't we all? I do like to hang out sometimes (or do I? .. is this just a Mr. Robot 
  moment?), but when I'm most comfortable, you'll probably find me deep in my 'interests' dir, or 
  reading about/playing with some new thing I found. Anyways, for the 'dir' thing to make since, 
  proceed below. I'll grant you read access.
